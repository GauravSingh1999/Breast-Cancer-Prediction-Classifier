# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Classifier
<p>Each record represents follow-up data for one breast cancer case. These are consecutive patients seen by Dr. Wolberg since 1984, and include only those cases exhibiting invasive breast cancer and no evidence of distant metastases at the time of diagnosis.</p>
<h4>This dataset contains 3 measures (mean, standard deviation, and worst) for 10 different cell features -
radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and
fractal dimension. All these features have been computed from a digitized image of a fine needle
aspirate of a breast mass, and they describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.</h4>
